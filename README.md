# Personal Projects

This repo serves as my personal portfolio of completed projects. I've decided to catalogue all my completed projects as a means of documenting my self learning journey.


# Outline:

## Machine Learning:

- Titanic (Classifier) :
  - Data collected from the famous kaggle competition. Used mix of sklearn, pandas, numpy.
