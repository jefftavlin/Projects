# Personal Projects

This repo serves as my personal portfolio of completed projects. I've decided to catalogue all my completed projects as a means of documenting my self learning journey.


#Outline:

The following categories are the various topics I've decided to tackle and complete. Each sub-folder contains projects within that domain; some quite simple while others slightly more complex.

- Machine Learning:
  - Classifier: Titanic Project. Data pulled from the kaggle competition.
- Regression: Housing Predictions. Data pulled from the kaggle competition.
  
- EDA
- Deep Learning
- MISC Applications
